# DATA TYPES 

- Data types describe the charachteristics of data.
- Data types can be divided into two:
    1. Primitive data types
    2. Non-primitive data types

**Primitive Data Types**
    - Primitive data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. 
    - Once a primitive data type is created we cannot modify it.
    - A primitive data type is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties.

    -- Types of Primitive Data Type
        1. Numbers - Integers, floats
        2. Null - empty value or no value
        3. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor
        4. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
        5. Booleans - true or false value
        6. BigInt - large numerical values(over 15 digits long), can create by placing 'n' at the end of a literal number.
        7. Undefined - a declared variable without a value

**Non Primitive Data Types**
    - Non-primitive data types are modifiable or mutable.
    - Once a primitive data type is created we can modify it.

    -- Types of Non Primitive Data Type
        1. Objects - an entity having properties and methods
        2. Arrays - store elements of same data type in consecutive location
