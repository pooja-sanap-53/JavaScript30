NOTES FOR DAY 16 

#JSON 
    - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    - JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
    - JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
    - JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
    - JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
    - JSON is language independent 
    - The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only
    - Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.
    - JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML
    - The key of a JSON object should be with double quotes or it should be a string


** Conversion **
    - In JavaScript the keyword JSON has parse() and stringify() methods. 
    - When we want to change the JSON to an object we parse the JSON using JSON.parse(). 
        Syntax:
            JSON.parse(json[, reviver])

    - When we want to change the object to JSON we use JSON.stringify().
        Syntax: 
            JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, space)
