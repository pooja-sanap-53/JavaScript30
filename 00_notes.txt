# REGULAR EXPRESSIONS 
    - A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data
    - A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types
    - Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations
    - To declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y
    Syntax : 
        /pattern/modifiers;

** RegExp parameters **
    - A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag.
        1. Pattern
            - A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which some sort of similarity
        2. Flags
            - Flags are optional parameters in a regular expression which determine the type of searching
            - g: a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text
            - i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase)
            - m: multiline 


** Using String Methods **
    - The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
    - The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.
