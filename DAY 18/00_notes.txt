NOTES FOR DAY 18 

#HTML5 Web Storage
    - Web Storage(sessionStorage and localStorage) is a new HTML5 API offering important benefits over traditional cookies. 
    - Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. 
    - Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. - The data storage limit of cookies in many web browsers is about 4 KB per cookie. 
    - Web Storages can store far larger data (at least 5MB) and never transferred to the server. 
    - All sites from the same or one origin can store and access the same data.

- The data being stored can be accessed using JavaScript, which gives you the ability to leverage client-side scripting to do many things that have traditionally involved server-side programming and relational databases. 
- It should be noted that data stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage is specific to the protocol of the page.
- The keys and the values are always strings (note that, as with objects, integer keys will be automatically converted to strings).
-There are five methods to work on local storage: setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), clear(), key()

1. sessionStorage
    - sessionStorage is only available within the browser tab or window session. 
    - Itâ€™s designed to store data in a single web page session. 
    - That means if the window is closed the session data will be removed. 
    - Since sessionStorage and localStorage has similar methods, we will focus only on localStorage.

2. localStorage
    - The HTML5 localStorage is the para of the web storage API which is used to store data on the browser with no expiration data. 
    - The data will be available on the browser even after the browser is closed. 
    - localStorage is kept even between browser sessions. 
    - This means data is still available when the browser is closed and reopened, and also instantly between tabs and windows.

**HTML5 Web Storage Objects**
HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:
    1. window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
    2. window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

**Web Storage objects**
    1. localStorage - to display the localStorage object
    2. localStorage.clear() - to remove everything in the local storage
    3. localStorage.setItem() - to store data in the localStorage. It takes a key and a value parameters.
    4. localStorage.getItem() - to display data stored in the localStorage. It takes a key as a parameter.
    5. localStorage.removeItem() - to remove stored item form a localStorage. It takes key as a parameter.
    6. localStorage.key() - to display a data stored in a localStorage. It takes index as a parameter.
