NOTES FOR DAY 4

#CONDITIONALS 
- Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions. 
- By default , statements in JavaScript script executed sequentially from top to bottom. 

** TYPES OF CONDITIONALS **
    1. If 
        - if is to used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code.
        Syntax :
            if(conditon){
                //code block
            }

    2. If , else
        - If condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed
        Syntax :
            if(conditon){
                //code block
            }
            else{
                //code block
            }

    3. if, else if, else
        - makes decision based on multiple conditions,  whichever is true is executed
        Syntax :
            if(conditon){
                //code block
            }
            else if (condition) {
                //code block
            }
            else{
                //code block
            }

    4. Switch case 
        - alternative to if, else if, else conditionals
        - The switch statement starts with a switch keyword followed by a parenthesis and code block.
        - Inside the code block we will have different cases.
        - Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value.
        - The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied. 
        - The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.
        Syntax:
            switch(case value ){
                case 1: 
                    //code
                    break;
                case 2:
                    //code
                    break;
                .
                .
                .
                case n:
                    //code
                    break;

                default : 
                    //code
            }
        
    5. Ternary Operator 
        - evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition
        Syntax:
            condition ? expression1 : expression2
        - If the condition is true, expression1 is executed.
        - If the condition is false, expression2 is executed.
