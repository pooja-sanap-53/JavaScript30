#LOOPS 
- used to perform repeititive tasks 
- helps us automate tasks 

Types of loop:
    1. For loop         -->   loop a bloack of code no of times 
    2. For in loop      -->   loop through the keys of an object 
    3. For of loop      -->   loop through the values of an object 
    4. while loop       -->   loops a block based on a specific condition 
    5. do-while loop    -->   while loop variant which runs atleat once 

1. FOR loop 
    Syntax: 
        for(initialization, condition, increment/decrement){
            // code goes here
        }

2. WHILE LOOP 
    Syntax:
        initialization
        while(condition){
            //code 
            increment/decrement;
        }
    
3. DO WHILE
    Syntax:
        initialization
        do{
            //code
            increment/decrement;
        } while(condition)

4. FOR OF 
    - used for arrays or values of object
    - used to iterate through an array if we are not interested in the index of each element in the array
    Syntax:
        for (const element of arr) {
            // code goes here
        }

5. FOR IN 
    - used for arrays or keys of object
    - Syntax:
        for (key in object){
            //code goes here
        }

**BREAK**
    - used to interrupt the loop 
    - used to jump out of the loop 
    - it ends the loop 

**CONTINUE**
    - used to skip a certain iteration and continues with next iterations
