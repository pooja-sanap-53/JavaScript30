NOTES FOR DAY 3 

# EXPRESSIONS
- A fragment of code produces a value is called an expression.
- Every value written is literally an expression.

# OPERATORS 

** ARITHMETIC OPERATORS **
    - arithmetic operators are mathematical operators 

    -- Types of Arithmetic operators
        1. Addition(+): a + b
        2. Subtraction(-): a - b
        3. Multiplication(*): a * b
        4. Division(/): a / b
        5. Modulus(%): a % b  --> gets the remainder after divison 
        6. Exponential(**): a ** b

** ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS **
    - used to assign a value to variable 

    -- Types of assignment operators
        1. =      -->   x = y
        2. +=     -->   x = x + y
        3. -=     -->   x = x - y
        3. *=     -->   x = x * y
        3. /=     -->   x = x / y
        3. %=     -->   x = x % y
        3. **=    -->   x = x ** y

** COMPARISON OPERATORS **
    - used to compare two operators
    - gives ouput as boolean value 

    -- Types of comparison operators 
        1. ==    -->  equal to
        2. !=    -->  not equal to
        3. ===   -->  equal value and type
        4. !==   -->  not equal value or not equal type 
        5. >     -->  greater than
        6. <     -->  less than
        7. >=    -->  greater than or equal to 
        8. <=    -->  less than or equal to 

** LOGICAL OPERATORS **
    - gives output as boolean values 
    
    -- Types of logical operators
        1. &&  -->  logical and (gets true only if the two operands are true)
        2. ||  -->  logical or (gets true either of the operand is true)
        3. !   -->  logical not (negates true to false and false to true)

** MISCELLANEOUS OPERATORS **

    1. Increment Operator 
        - used to increase a value stored in a variable

        i)  Pre increment operator (++x)
            - value is increased first and then printed 
       ii)  Post increment operator (x++)
            - value is printed first and then increased

    2. Decrement Operator 
        - used to decrease a value stored in a variable

        i)  Pre decrement operator (--x)
            - value is decreased first and then printed 
       ii)  Post decrement operator (x--)
            - value is printed first and then decreased

    3. Ternary Operator
        - allows to write a condition
        - evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition
        - only operator which requires three operands 
        Syntax:
            condition ? expression1 : expression2
        - If the condition is true, expression1 is executed.
        - If the condition is false, expression2 is executed.


# Comments 
    - are used to add annotations, hints, or exclude some code from being executed.

    1. Single Line Comment 
        - starts with //
        - ends with the end of line 

    2. Multiline Comment 
        - Starts with /*
        - Ends with */
        - Eveything between the opening /* and the closing */ is excluded from execution, even if the opening and closing are on different lines.
